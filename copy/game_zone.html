      <p class="style3">According to inscriptions and documents found by archaeologists, the Egyptians called their country Kemet, meaning "the          Black Land," a reference to the dark, fertile soil that remained after the Nile floodwaters had receded. They also used         another term, Deshret, or "the Red Land," a designation for the desert sands that burned under the blazing Sun. In         addition, they used the term Lower Egypt to refer to the northern delta area and the term Upper Egypt to refer to the         communities along the river all the way south to

         The abundance of the Nile and the Egyptians' careful management of the necessary dikes and irrigation systems guaranteed         a flourishing agricultural society. The variety of plants that grew and were cultivated could be used for many purposes,         including food, clothing, and shelter. The river was also the source of fish, and a fishing industry was established         early on. Mud from the river's banks was the raw material for a well-established pottery industry as well as for the         bricks used in construction. To navigate the Nile, the Egyptians learned to build all sorts of boats. The land provided         a wide variety of minerals, including several types of stone, semiprecious gems, salts, and metals such as gold, copper,         and—to a much lesser extent—silver. The Egyptians quarried, mined, and processed these resources. Trade with other         countries provided products not found in Egypt.

         Ongoing excavation in Egypt continually reshapes the views of scholars about the origins of Egyptian civilization. In         the late 20th century archaeologists discovered evidence of human habitation before 8000 bc in an area in the                  southwestern corner of Egypt, near the border with Sudan. Nomadic peoples may have been attracted to that area because          of the hospitable climate and environment. Now exceptionally dry, that area once had grassy plains and temporary lakes          that resulted from seasonal rains. The people who settled there must have realized the benefits of a more sedentary          life. Scientific analysis of the remains of their culture indicates that by 6000 bc they were herding cattle and          constructing large buildings. 

The descendants of these people may well have begun Egyptian civilization in the Nile Valley. About 2,000 years later, when the climate changed and the southwestern area became more arid, it is possible that they chose to migrate eastward to the Nile. Some of the distinctive characteristics of their society, such the structures they built and the emphasis they placed on cattle, support this theory. By 4000 bc there were settlements in Upper Egypt, at locations such as Hierakonpolis (ancient Nekhen), Naqada, and Abydos. 

Such a theory, however, explains only part of the picture of the early Egyptian civilization. A culture known as Badarian is represented as early as 5000 bc in Upper Egyptian settlements. Moreover, in Lower Egypt, Neolithic settlements in the Al Fayyūm area date from more than 1,000 years earlier. Several sites in that area show evidence of agriculture by around 5000 bc. Merimde, at the Nile Delta's western border, may have been almost as old, and a settlement at Buto appears to date from around 4500 bc. The style and decoration of the pottery found at these sites differ from those of pottery found in Upper Egypt. The northern type eventually fell out of use. Other differences between the peoples in Upper Egypt and Lower Egypt include the nature of their architecture and the arrangements for burial of the dead, the latter perhaps signifying differing religious beliefs.
