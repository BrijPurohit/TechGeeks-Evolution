      Darksiders delighted PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 users at the beginning
 of the year with fun hack and slash gameplay combined with clever 
puzzles and a variety of different weapons.<img src="images/darksiders.png" alt="darksiders_gameplayimage" align="left" border="4px"  hspace="10px" /></p>
<p  align="justify">
 Now, the game has arrived on the PC and its time to see if its 
console-specific gameplay has withstood the porting process and if it 
delivers an exciting experience.</p>

<p  align="justify">&nbsp; </p>
<p  align="justify"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 128);"><span style="font-size: medium;">Story</span></span>
</p>
<p  align="justify">
 The story is about one of the four horsemen of the Apocalypse, War, and
 how he was summoned to Earth to deliver justice onto the three 
Kingdoms, that of Heaven, Hell and of the humans, even though it wasn't 
his time.</p><p  align="justify">
 As you can imagine, that posed a problem for the Supreme Council, the 
highest form of power in Darksiders' universe, so after the destruction 
was all said and done, they punished War by stripping him of his powers 
and sending him to find out why the signal for the Apocalypse was given 
in the first place.</p><p  align="justify">
 While that may not sound pretty interesting, the story is actually 
extremely well balanced, even though its main protagonist isn't exactly 
the most easy going guy. Luckily, his lack of personality is made up for
 by his "watcher", a spirit voiced by none other than Mark Hamill, the 
man behind the voice of the Joker from the Batman animated series and 
video game.</p><p  align="justify">
The rest of the characters War meets in his journey are pretty well
 characterized, and you can see that some work has went into fleshing 
them out to keep the story interesting and, most importantly, relevant 
to the actions on screen. Throw in twists and turns, as well as some 
major reveals, and Darksiders is definitely top notch from a story 
standpoint.
 </p><p  align="justify">
 <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 128);"><span style="font-size: medium;">Gameplay</span></span></p><p  align="justify">To put it bluntly, Darksiders isn't the most original of titles, as
 it features elements from a variety of popular franchises including God
 of War, The Legend of Zelda, Portal and Batman: Arkham Asylum. While 
some accused its developer, Vigil Games, of downright stealing from the 
aforementioned titles, the studio actually combined all these things 
into one cohesive experience.</p><p  align="justify">
 The fighting takes cues from God of War and Devil May Cry, the 
puzzle solving from Zelda or Portal while the environment interactions 
and changes remind of Arkham Asylum, but all of these were great titles,
 and Darksiders made a good move by following them.</p><p  align="justify">
 
		It's one thing to downright steal things and copy paste them into your
 own work, but Vigil really made Darksiders its own when it carefully 
combined these things and made them work together for a better 
experience.</p>
 <p  align="justify">
 
 That doesn't make it perfect though, as the game has quite a few 
faults. First off, War isn't exactly the most agile of protagonists, so 
when he's forced to executive complicated acrobatic moves or time his 
jumps to the millimeter, things often go wrong.</p><p  align="justify">
 We should also mention the puzzles. While some are pretty simple and 
rewarding when you figure them out, others, specifically ones toward the
 end of the game, are extremely complicated and will certainly make some
 players quit the game entirely. Throw in the multiple new weapons and 
equipment War gets throughout the game, including an extending whip, a 
Portal-like gun or a crossblade, all that need to be used during such 
puzzles, and a migraine is almost guaranteed.</p><p  align="justify">
 
 Darksiders also follows some classic adventure game tropes, including 
forcing you to backtrack through different environments to hunt out 
special items, with such a quest being given right before the final boss
 fight. While the world is varied enough to still be interesting, such 
quests just artificially extend the play time, and will definitely bore a
 lot of players.

<p  align="justify">
 The PC version of Darksiders is a pretty good port of the console 
edition, but, sadly, has quite a lot of bugs, especially towards the 
end, with crashes and freezes right in the heat of combat. As such, 
maybe it should have gotten a bit more quality assurance testing before 
it was released.
</p><p  align="justify">
 The mouse and keyboard control scheme is also a bit weird sometimes, 
when it asks you to push multiple keys at the same time, but, in the 
end, it takes care of the job and allows War to survive his endless 
battles and puzzles through the game world. Still, a PC controller might
 be better suited for the game, but only if you get it working.
 </p><p  align="justify">
  
  
 <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 128);"><span style="font-size: medium;">Graphics
 and Audio</span></span></p><p  align="justify">
 Unlike many games that are currently being released, Darksiders 
actually uses a full color palette, not limiting itself to gray and 
brown, with the occasional red blood. Fighting is beautifully done, and 
the enemies are varied enough to keep things interesting. You will 
witness different colors one after another, eventually culminating with 
the enemy's red blood and the eventual blue (money), yellow (rage) or 
green orbs (health) earned by killing him.</p><p  align="justify">
 The world is also extremely varied, going from desolate cities to 
deserts, underground tunnels, water lagoons or even cemeteries, each 
with its own feel and interconnected by the whole game.</p><p  align="justify">
 The audio is pretty well done, with orchestral scores highlighting the 
intense battles and slower ones during exploring sections. The voice 
work is top notch, and even though War's voice is a bit lacking in 
personality, Hamill and other characters more than make up for it.</p><p  align="justify">
 <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 128);"><span style="font-size: medium;">Conclusion</span></span></p><p  align="justify">
 Overall, Darksiders for the PC is a very good game, even if it has 
quite a few bugs and might crash from time to time. It is an adequate 
hack and slash for the PC, which definitely needs to be congratulated 
for the courage it showed in order to appear on this platform.</p><p  align="justify">
 The adventures of War are quite exciting and the world of Darksiders is
 a nice one to find yourself immersed in.<br>
