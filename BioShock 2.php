      A little lighter on
 story, atmosphere and pure shock, it's nevertheless much better when it
 comes to the fighting, introducing some nice challenges and simplifying
 most of the exploration of Rapture. Oh, and it's got a multiplayer mode
 that, although has some lag issues, could draw quite a crowd.</p>

<p  align="justify"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 128);"><span
 style="font-size: medium;">Plot</span></span><br><br>Rapture 
is still there, at the bottom of the sea, and a new ideology and power 
filled the vacuum caused by the death of Andrew Ryan and by the defeat 
of Fontaine in his super-powered form. Sophia Lamb is a psychologist who
 worked with Hiroshima survivors and came to the libertarian utopia in 
order to treat those who had problems with <img src="images/Bio1.png" alt="BioShock_image" align="RIGHT" border="4px"  hspace="10px" />the underwater life. Seeing 
the city and the vision that powers it, she decides that her own 
communalism is more suited and she debates Ryan before the events of the
 first game. She seems to have managed to create a new social system in 
Rapture, with the Splicers, the Big Daddies and the Little Sisters all 
part of The Family, directly under her control.</p>

<p  align="justify">The player 
crashes into the game universe, being early on established that they 
were linked with Eleanor, Lamb's daughter. As the game progresses, other
 characters linked to Eleanor and Lamb are encountered and a picture 
emerges of the plans linking the two with the main character. While the 
story itself might lack the gut punching moment present in the first, 
the ultimate payoff is much more satisfying and emotional, making it 
worth it to play through twice to get at least two of the four endings.</p>

<p  align="justify"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 128);"><span 
style="font-size: medium;">Gameplay</span></span><br><br>The
 basic template of the initial BioShock is still used. There are areas 
of Rapture that the player explores, filled with Splicers, Little 
Sisters and accompanying Big Daddies. The player can now use plasmids 
and weapons at the same time, making combat more fluid and opening up 
more options to <img src="images/Bio2.png" alt="Bioshock_image" align="left" border="4px"  hspace="10px" />deal with enemies. The Splicers also seem a bit smarter,
 especially in large numbers, able to circle around the player and work 
in team to distract them. The areas appear a bit larger and more ammo 
and health dispensers spread around.</p>

<p  align="justify">The early Big Daddy model 
you inhabit needs ADAM, health and EVE to survive, and the Rapture you 
visit seems a bit tougher to navigate. The big Daddy fights are pretty 
much on par with those in the first BioShock and the newly introduced 
Big Sister battles, happening near the end of the levels, seem much less
 punishing than the developers let on in press statements, with a combo 
of lightning attacks and mini-guns or rivet bullets making short work of
 them.</p>

<p  align="justify">The hacking has been tweaked so that the process is 
shorter and less boring and the introduction of the auto hack dart makes
 taking out turrets and cameras trivial. There are more plasmid-based 
powers to use but I found that tonics much more important, especially 
those that make the player dish out damage and elemental effect when 
being hit.</p>

<p  align="justify">A special mention for fun goes to the gathering 
sections where the player needs to defend a Little Sister as she gets 
precious ADAM from corpses. The points where these mini last stands 
happen are carefully placed by the developers to allow gamers to build 
plans before they put the Little Sister down and even place some traps 
around to help in the fight. The variety of strategies is only limited 
by the weapons you carry and by the proximity of an ammo dispenser. 
Later on, when enemies get tougher, the tension escalates and the need 
for more ADAM is countered by that of conserving resources that can be 
drained in the combat.</p>

<p  align="justify"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 128);"><span 
style="font-size: medium;">Visuals and audio</span></span><br><br>Rapture
 has never looked so good, as the two years separating the titles in the
 series are clearly obvious in the graphics, but it would have been nice
 on the part of 2K to offer a bit more diversity in the looks of the 
levels. Dionysus Park is unique in its looks and the underwater 
segments, although lacking gameplay relevance, offer a nice change of 
scenery but the industrial feel of most of the other areas can feel a 
bit depressing and desolate after a while. The Family was supposed to 
have brought Rapture to a state of actual peace and stability before the
 re-entry of the player and maybe the<img src="images/Bio3l.png" alt="BioShock_image" align="RIGHT" border="4px"  hspace="10px"/> way the areas look should have 
reflected that a bit more. Still, the graphics will not get in the way 
of the experience and there's a segment later in the game where the 
contrast between two ways of texturing the same area is quite well 
played for dramatic effect.</p>

<p  align="justify">The audio logs continue to be among 
the most interesting elements of the game universe. As in the first 
BioShock, you can run into quite a lot of snippets linked to how the 
history of Rapture played out before the gamer entered it. The 
interactions between Andrew Ryan and Sophia Lamb are especially 
interesting, as are the few linked diaries left behind by the father who
 went to Rapture to save his kidnapped daughter, especially when you get
 to meet him later. The locations and contents for some of them don't 
make a lot of sense but they are so integral to the atmosphere that it 
would have been a shame on the part of the developers to dial back their
 use.</p>

<p  align="justify"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 128);"><span 
style="font-size: medium;">Multiplayer</span></span><br><br>One
 of the big changes for BioShock 2 has been the introduction of 
multiplayer, something the original lacked. Digital Extremes, which has 
long been involved in the Unreal Tournament series, took all the 
elements central to the game universe and translated them into 
multiplayer. There are vending machines to be emptied, Big Daddy suits 
to win and then use, turrets to hack, downed enemies to research for 
future advantages and the concept of looking for the ultimate 
combination of plasmid and weapon, which delivers the biggest damage and
 incapacitates the enemy for the longest time. </p>

<p  align="justify">One problem is 
that the developers have decided that the Modern Warfare model needs to 
be followed, with experience leading to gained levels that grant new 
plasmids. The upside is a bit more interest and engagement with the 
game, while the downside is the fact that high level players have some 
advantages, like the use of those annoying bees. The multiplayer is also
 set to get some new content in March, with the Sinclair Test Solutions 
Pack adding fresh options.</p>

<p  align="justify"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 128);"><span
 style="font-size: medium;">Conclusion</span></span><br><br>BioShock
 2 is a game definitely worth playing but those who engage in it need 
not expect the same experience delivered by its predecessor. There are 
some rough edges, the experience seems too short for me and the 
multiplayer offerings really don't add a lot, but the core of the 
videogame is <img src="images/Bio4.png" alt="BioShock_imge" align="left" border="4px"  hspace="10px" />brilliantly designed, well built and delivers some genuine 
thrills when it comes to the more complex Big Sister pre-arranged fights
 and to the mini last stand elements built around ADAM gathering.</p>

<p  align="justify">It
 will be interesting to see whether 2K Games and its various studios 
will create a third game in the BioShock universe. There's certainly 
place for it left at the end of this experience and it could be 
something entirely different, with the player and some fundamental 
elements like the Little Sisters separated from Rapture and affecting 
the surface world for the first time. Just make it longer and evolve the
 story enough to shock as much as that of the first BioShock.
