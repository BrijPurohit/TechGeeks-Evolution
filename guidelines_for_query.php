  Please first take the time to check the documentation and Frequently Asked Questions pages before asking a question. Nobody likes answering the same questions over and over!</p>

<li><p  align="justify"><b>Attachments are sometimes allowed </b>in few of the groups, but note that articles greater than 40 KB in size are rejected because they draw too much bandwidth. <br>If you have a large file that you would like to share with fellow newsgroup readers, you should upload it to a web site and post a link to the file. (Please don't split articles into multiple parts to circumvent the size restriction.)</p>
</li>
<li><p  align="justify">Note that certain types of attachments are automatically rejected: EXE/COM (as they may be viruses/worms) and BMP. When posting images, use PNG or GIF instead of BMP since they are compressed formats.</p>
</li>
<li><p  align="justify"><b>Please do not post in HTML,</b> unless it's absolutely necessary to demonstrate a point. HTML posts are usually just a waste of bandwidth and disk space, and not all groups support HTML.</p>
</li>
<li><p  align="justify"><b>Please do not e-mail the copies of articles you post; </b>one should see them on the group. Also, if you initiate a thread on a group, please post any replies to the group instead of sending them to them by e-mail. This way all may benefit from the answers.</p>
